# Beginner Level: Basic Syntax & Variables
# Simple Print Statement
# Write a Python program to print "Hello, Python!".

# Using Comments
# Add a single-line and multi-line comment in a Python script explaining what it does.

# Declare and Print Variables
# Assign your name to a variable and print it.

# Variable Naming
# Identify which of the following are valid variable names and correct the invalid ones:

# Edit
# 1name = "Alice"
# my name = "Bob"
# _age = 25
# city@home = "New York"
# Multiple Assignments
# Assign "apple", "banana", and "cherry" to variables x, y, and z in a single line.

# Swapping Two Variables
# Swap the values of a and b without using a third variable.

# Global Variable Usage
# Create a global variable x inside a function and modify it.

# Intermediate Level: Data Types & Numbers
# Identify Data Types
# Given the variables below, print their data types:

# python
# Copy
# Edit
# x = 5
# y = 2.5
# z = "Hello"
# w = True
# Basic Arithmetic Operations
# Write a Python program to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using two numbers provided by the user.

# Number Type Conversion
# Convert:

# 10 into a float
# 5.99 into an integer
# "42" into an integer
# Even or Odd Checker
# Write a Python program that checks whether a given number is even or odd.

# Sum of Digits
# Take a number input from the user and return the sum of its digits.
# Example: 123 → 1+2+3 = 6

# Reverse a Number
# Write a Python script that takes a number and returns its reverse.
# Example: 123 → 321
